		one: `The Sikh Temple of Yuba City in Yuba City, California was opened on October 21, 1969 and serves over 20,000 Sikhs in the area which is home to many Sikhs and Punjabis. The Gurdwara has a main Langar hall and prayer hall.`,
		two: `The Yuba City Sikh festival is one of the biggest and most spectacular Sikhism annual events in all of Northern California drawing hundreds of thousands of devotees and spectators. The three day Guru Gadee (Gaddi) Diwas festivities celebrate the inaugural anniversary of Guru Granth Sahib, Sikhism's holy scripture. Gurpurab events which include worship services and kirtan climax with Nagar Kirtan, an annual procession in which Sikhs carry the scripture from the gurdwara on to a float and parade through the streets of Yuba City singing devotional hymns. Cramming the gurdwara grounds and spilling out to line the parade route are bazaars with wares catering to every whim and need associated with Sikhism interspersed with free food booths offering every sort of delectable langar.`

		sikhism: `Sikhism`,
		header: `God in Sikhism is known as Ik Onkar, the One Supreme Reality or the all-pervading spirit (which is taken to mean God). This spirit has no gender in Sikhism, though translations may present it as masculine. It is also Akaal Purkh (beyond time and space) and Nirankar (without form). In addition, Nanak wrote that there are many worlds on which it has created life`,
		one: `Sikhism (Punjabi: ਸਿੱਖੀ), or Sikhi (Sikkhī), pronounced, from Sikh, meaning a "disciple", or a "learner"), is a monotheistic religion that originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent about the end of the 15th century. It is one of the youngest of the major world religions, and the fifth-largest. The fundamental beliefs of Sikhism, articulated in the sacred scripture Guru Granth Sahib, include faith and meditation on the name of the one creator, divine unity and equality of all humankind, engaging in selfless service, striving for social justice for the benefit and prosperity of all, and honest conduct and livelihood while living a householder's life. In the early 21st century there were nearly 25 million Sikhs worldwide, the great majority of them (20 million) living in Punjab, the Sikh homeland in northwest India, and about 2 million living in neighbouring Indian states, formerly part of the Indian Punjab.`,
		two: `Sikhism is based on the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak, the first Guru (1469–1539), and the nine Sikh gurus that succeeded him. The Tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, named the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib as his successor, terminating the line of human Gurus and making the scripture the eternal, religious spiritual guide for Sikhs. Sikhism rejects claims that any particular religious tradition has a monopoly on Absolute Truth.`,
		three: `The Sikh scripture opens with Ik Onkar (ੴ), its Mul Mantar and fundamental prayer about One Supreme Being (God). Sikhism emphasizes simran (meditation on the words of the Guru Granth Sahib), that can be expressed musically through kirtan or internally through Nam Japo (repeat God's name) as a means to feel God's presence. It teaches followers to transform the "Five Thieves" (lust, rage, greed, attachment, and ego). Hand in hand, secular life is considered to be intertwined with the spiritual life. Guru Nanak taught that living an "active, creative, and practical life" of "truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity" is above the metaphysical truth, and that the ideal man is one who "establishes union with God, knows His Will, and carries out that Will". Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh Guru, established the political/temporal (Miri) and spiritual (Piri) realms to be mutually coexistent.`,
		four: `Sikhism evolved in times of religious persecution. Two of the Sikh gurus – Guru Arjan (14 April 1563 – 25 May 1605) and Guru Tegh Bahadur (12 April 1621 – 19 December 1675), were tortured and executed by the Mughal rulers after they refused to convert to Islam. The persecution of Sikhs triggered the founding of the Khalsa, as an order to protect the freedom of conscience and religion, with qualities of a "Sant-Sipāhī" – a saint-soldier.`

		one: `Festivities begin Friday with flag raising of the Nishan Sahib bearing the Khalsa crest. Free food is available to all comers during the entire weekend event. Worship services featuring kirtan are held Friday and Saturday mornings and evenings. Sunday morning gurdwara services center around ceremonies led by Granthis transporting Guru Granth Sahib from the hosting Tierra Buena Gurdwara onto a decorated palanquin which heads up the parade. Sword dancing gatka troupes demonstrate their skill as devotees throng through the streets. Participating floats overflow with sangat representing gurdwaras from all over California, all around the USA and even Canada. Spectators mingle with sevadars serving free food and and vendors of colorful bazaars to line the parade route in a happy jumble of humanity.`,
		two: `The Yuba City Nagar Kirtan inaugural festival takes place in fall. Because of all the planning involved the Guru Gadee parade cannot be postponed due to weather conditions and takes place rain or shine. In the case of rainy weather, floats are wrapped in protective plastic sheeting. Tents protect bazaars and food booths. Local businesses supply rain gear. Spectators and devotees deck out in an array of creative weather proofing. Rather than dampening spirits, stormy skies and showers seem to lend an ambiance of exhilaration for those dedicated devotees willing to brave the elements.`,
